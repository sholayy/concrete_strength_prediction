# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This analysis uses various machine learning models to predict the concrete compressive strength based on its mixture components and age. Concrete strength is crucial for ensuring the safety and longevity of structures, making this prediction task vital for optimizing material use and ensuring construction standards are met.

## Data Description

The dataset comprises 1030 instances with 9 attributes related to concrete mixtures and their compressive strength:
- Cement
- Blast Furnace Slag
- Fly Ash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
- Age
- Concrete Compressive Strength (MPa)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our EDA revealed:
- No missing values in the dataset.
- The distribution of concrete strength is somewhat normal but right-skewed, indicating a concentration of samples around the mean strength with some exceptional higher values.
- Positive correlation between cement content and concrete strength, suggesting higher cement quantities generally contribute to stronger concrete.
- Age also positively impacts strength, with concrete generally gaining strength over time, though the rate of increase diminishes.
- An inverse relationship between water content and strength, highlighting the importance of optimizing water content to achieve desired strength levels.

## Machine Learning Models

Several models were evaluated for their ability to predict concrete strength:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine

The **Random Forest model** and **Gradient Boosting model**  outperformed others with an **R^2 score of 0.89**, indicating excellent predictive ability. Other metrics used to evaluate this model included Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), with values of (26.82,26.49) and (5.17,5.15), respectively, further attesting to the model's accuracy.

## Model Optimization

I optimized the Random Forest model using GridSearchCV, focusing on hyperparameters such as the number of estimators and the maximum depth of the trees. However, the final result didn't improve the correlation coefficient.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrated that machine learning could effectively predict concrete compressive strength, with the Random Forest AND Gradient Boosting models showing particularly strong performance. This predictive capability could be highly beneficial in construction and materials science, enabling more efficient resource use and ensuring structural integrity.
